## Description
This product will help in identifying whether a triangle is an isosceles, equilateral, scalene or NOT a triangle at all.
Some of the functionality key points to note are:

- An equilateral triangle must have all it's sides equal.
- An isosceles triangle has two of its sides exactly equal.
- As for an scalene triangle, none of the sides is equal. However, the sum of any two sides of the triangle must be greater than the third side.
NB: If the sum of any two sides of the triangle is equal to or less than the third remaining side, then a triangle CANNOT be formed using those values. (For example, the values 9,4 & 3 cannot form a triangle.)
